For the backend services, we can TypeScript + Node.js.
Common frameworks and libraries include:

HTTP Framework: Fastify is often preferred for performance and TypeScript support.
Task Scheduling/Job Runner: Since weâ€™ll be dealing with scheduled data ingestion, we are using node-cron.
HTTP Client: axios for making requests to external data providers.
Environment Configuration: dotenv for loading environment variables.
Linting and Formatting: eslint, prettier.
Testing: jest for unit tests.
